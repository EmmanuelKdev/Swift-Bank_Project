## 📱 App Architecture

### 1. Clean Architecture
The app follows Clean Architecture principles with the following layers:

lib/
├── core/ # Core functionality and utilities
├── data/ # Data layer (repositories, data sources)
├── domain/ # Business logic and entities
├── presentation/ # UI layer (screens, widgets)
└── main.dart

#### 🔧 Layer Details
- **Core**: 🛠️ Contains common utilities, constants, and shared components
- **Data**: 💾 Handles data operations and external services
- **Domain**: 🏢 Contains business logic and use cases
- **Presentation**: 🎨 Manages UI components and state management

### 2. ⭐ Key Features

- 🔐 Secure authentication (Biometric, 2FA)
- 👤 Account management
- 📊 Transaction history
- 💸 Fund transfers
- 💳 Bill payments
- 📄 Account statements
- 🔔 Push notifications
- ⚙️ Profile management

### 3. 🔄 State Management
- 🧩 BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management
